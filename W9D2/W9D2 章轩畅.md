* traditional method

  $x_i=a_i\ mod\ m$

  $y_i= a_i/m$

  > problem: division operation is too slow

* Gao Q.S's method

  $x_i=a_i\ mod\ m$

  $y_i= a_i\ mod\ l$

  > modulus operation is faster than division operation
  
  * uniqueness of mapping
  
    Let $m=2^k-1$ and $l=2^s$, obviously $l$ and $m$ is relatively prime, then by **Chinese Remainder Theorem** it's easy to prove the uniqueness of mapping
  
  * specific mapping operation
  
    Notice that $l=2^s$, then by **Binary** **Exponentiation**, $y_i= a_i\ mod\ l$ is relatively fast.
  
    As for $x_i=a_i\ mod\ m$, we notice that $a_i=q(2^k-1)+x_i=q\cdot 2^k+x_i-q$, so we divide $a_i$(binary form) into groups of $k$ digits, assume their value is $c_i$, we have 
    $$
    a_i=\sum c_i\cdot2^{ik}=\sum c_i(2^k-1+1)^i\\
    $$
    Then
    $$
    a_i\ mod\ (2^k-1)=\sum c_i.
    $$
